# Challenge

Build a form to call [Random User API](https://randomuser.me) and create a list of users. The HTML form should have at least one input to enter the number of users to generate and a submit button.

The results should be presented on the same page and updated every time the submit button is clicked. You can decide how to show the list of users and any other aspect not specified in this file.

The code design will be evaluated during the interview.
